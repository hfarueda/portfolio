abstract = {The wavelength dependence of atmospheric absorption creates range cues in hyperspectral measurements that can be exploited for passive ranging using only thermal emissions. In this work, we present fundamental limits on absorption-based ranging under a model of known air temperature and wavelength-dependent attenuation coefficient, with object temperature and emissivity unknown; reflected solar and environmental radiance is omitted from our analysis. Fisher information computations illustrate how performance limits depend on atmospheric conditions such as air temperature and humidity; temperature contrast in the scene; spectral resolution of measurement; and distance. These results should prove valuable in sensor system design.},
